<h1>Venice</h1>

<p>Venice is the capital of northern Italy's Veneto region. It was built on over 100 small islands in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. There are no roads, just canals weaving through the city. Venice is also home to the one of the world's narrowest roads, Calletta, which measures at about 53cm wide.</p>

<p>Another way to get around Venice is walking. It's possible to get anywhere in the city on foot. The bridges throught Venice make it possible to go from island to island quickly. By 2017, there were nearly 400 bridges that were in use for foot traffic.</p>

<p>Because of its small size and lack of roads, there are no motorized land vehicles allowed. Some people paddle through the canals running through the city. The traditional gondole that are associated with Venice are slowly being replaced by motorized ones. Still, tourists pay a fair bit of money to ride in a traditional gondola.</p>
