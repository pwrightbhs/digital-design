<h1>Rome</h1>
	
	<p>Rome is the capital of Italy. It is a large, cosmopolitan city with almost 3000 years of influential art, architecture and culture on display. This city has been on Earth for nearly 28 centuries. All through the city, there are examples of architecture from nearly every movement in Italy. It's the fourth most populated city in the European Union.</p>

<p>Aqueducts like these were built to carry clean water to the fountains of Rome. There were 9 that all fed into the city. Those 9 aqueducts supplied enough water for 39 fountains and 591 public baths. And that's excluding the amount of water supplied to the Imperial Household.</p>

<p>Present day Rome contains 280 fountains and over 900 churches. The fountains were to provide the people of Rome with clean drinking water. The amount of churches come from the many wars fought over religion in Italy.</p>
