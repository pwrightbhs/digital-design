<p>The Colosseum, or Flavian Ampitheatre, is currently the largest ampitheater to ever be built. It's 188m long, and could seat up to 55,000 spectators. There were originally 80 arched entrances. At the time, as many as 240 masts were attached to stone corbels on the 4th level.</p>

<p>The Roman Emperor Vespesian commissioned it to be built, but his son, Titus completed it. Vespesian ordered it to be build on the site of Nero's palace in an effort to dissociate himself from the hated tyrant. He wanted to gain popularity with elaborate stagings of deadly combats and animal fights. In just one year, over 9000 animals were killed in the ring.</p>

<p>Gladiators would fight in the center and spectators would watch from the stands. When the floor became too bloody, fresh sand would be poured and the shows would continue. Gladiators were most commonly Roman slaves brought in for the enjoyment of the citizens. Citizens would be seated according to rank or social status.</p>
